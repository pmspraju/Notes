Encoder: The encoder processes the input sequence (e.g., a sentence) one timestep at a time. At each timestep, it produces a hidden state (hidden variable) that captures information about the input sequence up to that point. By the end of the input sequence, the encoder has produced a series of hidden states, with the final hidden state ideally encapsulating the entire input sequence's context.

Decoder: The decoder then takes this final hidden state (or a series of hidden states) to generate the output sequence (e.g., a translated sentence). It also processes one timestep at a time, producing its own hidden states and output at each step. The decoder uses the hidden state information from the encoder to guide its generation of the output sequence.

In summary, the hidden states from the encoder carry rich contextual information about the input sequence, which the decoder can leverage at each timestep to produce a coherent and accurate output sequence. This interplay between the encoder and decoder hidden states is what enables the powerful sequence-to-sequence modeling capabilities of RNN-based encoder-decoder architectures.

#### prompt - let us say if we have 10 examples in our dataset, so during training, does each example go throught encoder and decoder

Yes, exactly! During training, each example in your dataset goes through both the encoder and the decoder.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the process for each example:

1. **Encoding:**
   - The input sequence (e.g., a sentence) is passed through the encoder.
   - The encoder processes the sequence one timestep at a time, producing a hidden state at each step. These hidden states capture the information and context of the input sequence.

2. **Decoding:**
   - The final hidden state (or series of hidden states) from the encoder is then used to initialize the decoder.
   - The decoder generates the output sequence one timestep at a time, using the hidden states from the encoder to inform and guide the generation process.

3. **Loss Calculation and Backpropagation:**
   - The generated output sequence is compared to the actual target sequence (the ground truth).
   - The difference between the generated sequence and the target sequence is used to calculate the loss.
   - Backpropagation is then applied to update the model parameters, aiming to minimize the loss.

This process is repeated for each of the 10 examples in your dataset during each training epoch. The model iteratively learns and adjusts its parameters to improve its performance in generating accurate output sequences based on the input sequences.

In summary, each example in your dataset goes through both the encoder and the decoder, contributing to the training and refinement of the model.

#### Prompt - on what factors, the number of timesteps dependen, on the number of RNN units ?

Great question! The number of timesteps and the number of RNN units are related but depend on different factors:

1. **Number of Timesteps:**
   - **Length of Input Sequence:** The number of timesteps in an RNN is typically determined by the length of the input sequence. For example, if you're processing a sentence with 10 words, there will be 10 timesteps, one for each word.
   - **Padding:** In practice, sequences in a dataset may have different lengths. To handle this, sequences are often padded to a common length, resulting in the number of timesteps equal to the length of the longest sequence (or a predefined maximum length).
   - **Truncation:** Sometimes, very long sequences are truncated to a maximum length to manage computational efficiency, setting the number of timesteps to this maximum length.

2. **Number of RNN Units:**
   - **Model Complexity:** The number of RNN units (also called hidden units or hidden neurons) defines the dimensionality of the hidden states. More units allow the model to capture more complex patterns but also increase computational load and risk of overfitting.
   - **Architecture Design:** The number of RNN units is a design choice made based on the problem requirements. For tasks requiring high complexity and precision (like machine translation), a larger number of units might be chosen.
   - **Resource Constraints:** Available computational resources (like memory and processing power) can influence the choice of the number of RNN units. Larger models require more resources.

In summary, **the number of timesteps** is primarily determined by the length of the input sequence and how sequences are managed (padding or truncation). **The number of RNN units**, on the other hand, depends on the complexity of the problem, the design choices for the architecture, and available computational resources. Both parameters together influence the model's performance and computational requirements.
